->Highlights: Data preprocessing : Cleaned and handled null values in the data set

->Exploratory Data Analysis: Explored relationships between features and visualized distributions.

->Label encoding are performed to change the classified values to numerical values.

->Correlation Analysis: Identified and addressed multicollinearity issues.

->Outlier Treatment: Applied strategies to handle outliers in numerical features.

->Target Variable Transformation: Ensured normality of the target variable through logarithmic transformation.

->Feature Selection: RFE(Recursive Feature Extraction)technique performed to select the best features.

->Model Building: Developed a logistic regression model and assessed its performance.
